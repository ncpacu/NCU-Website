Last updated 24 Jan 2022 | By Leon

Public Forum (PF) debate is a type of debate that is common in US high schools. A team in PF consists of two people that are either speaker 1 or 2.

## Debate Topics

PF debate topics are diverse, but most of them are high academic and would require some in-depth research in order to understand. For example, the topics that I have done over the course of the last few years include:

- Resolved: Countries should prioritize climate change adaptation over mitigation.
- Resolved: States should eliminate their arsenals of nuclear weapons.
- Resolved: Countries should not impose price controls on the pharmaceutical industry.
- Resolved: The United States should remove nearly all of its military presence in the Middle East.

As you can see, all of the debate topics are presented as resolutions for a problem, and you job in a PF debate is to either affirm or negate that position.

The side that advocates the resolution is call the Pro side, whereas the side that rejects the position is known as the Con side. Usually, you don't know your team's position until right before the debate, which means that you need to prepare to debate on both sides.

## The Procedure

Team A Speaker 1: Constructive speech (4 min)
Team B Speaker 1: Constructive speech (4 min)
Cross fire between Team A Speaker 1 and Team B Speaker 1 (3 min)
Team A Speaker 2: Rebuttal (4 min)
Team B Speaker 2: Rebuttal (4 min)
Cross fire between Team A Speaker 2 and Team B Speaker 2 (3 min)
Team A Speaker 1: Summary (3 min)
Team B Speaker 1: Summary (3 min)
Grand crossfire (everyone) (3 min)
Team A Speaker 2: Final focus (2 min)
Team B Speaker 2: Final focus (2 min)

Both teams have 4 minutes of additional preparation time that they can call for.

## Debate Tournaments

If you are interested in participating in a debate tournament, there are plenty of opportunities out there. For first-timers, my recommendation is to just go and join one since, as far as I know, that's best way to learn what it is about. (Also, if you lose your first tournament you probably don't need to feel ashamed because that's your first tournament)

### NHSDLC

NHSDLC (National High School Debate League of China) was founded by two American educators in 2011 to bring PF debate to China and has grown into a big debate organisation spanning over 35 cities in China^[https://www.nhsdlc.com/our-story]. There are usually two NHSDLC regional tournaments a year along with a national tournament. Additionally, they provide opportunities for you to connect with other debaters and oversea debate tournaments by providing summer camps and invitation programmes. Based on my personal experience, NHSDLC is quite beginner friendly and I definitely recommend signing up this if you are new. 

You can learn more at the [NHSDLC official website](https://www.nhsdlc.cn/)

### NSDA

The NSDA (National Speech and Debate Association) also tournament hosts debate tournaments in China. Though I have not been to an NSDA tournament, I have heard that NSDA is slightly more difficult than NHSDLC, but you can certainly give it a try.

NSDA also hosts tournaments in the US. This is a much more intense intense competition so be ready to take challenges (you can see this from how they change topic every 2 months)

## Why Debate?

The whole process of preparing for a debate and participating in a debate tournament requires participants to use a large variety of language skills. When preparing for a debate, debaters need to do a lot of research about the debate topic, which includes, for example, papers from academia, news coverage, government websites, announcements from companies, and opinion of practitioners. As a result, debaters will learn many vocabulary (since the reading materials are very academic and contains technical terms) and thus improve their English skill level. When writing a case for the debate, debaters need to learn how to use evidence effectively to support their argument while making sure that the language being used is clear, concise, and convincing. During a round, debaters also practise their speaking skill as they will need to speak quickly, academically, and persuasively during the debate. Additionally, you get to have fun and make friends, which is cool!

## Debate Club

Yes, there is (at least at the time of writing) a debate club in NCPA.

The ASA aims to promote students' awareness of global issues and develop their ability to take in-depth look into debate topics through researching and synthesising information, making connections between arguments, and practicing oral presentation. The agenda for debate club over the course of a trimester is be flexible depending on debate tournaments outside the school, but we will ensure that members can learn about the public forum procedure and how to succeed in a debate round.

If you are interested, keep an eye out for that when signing up for ASA.
