Last updated 15 Feb 2022 \| By Leon

## Introduction

The International Linguistics Olympiads is not about knowing and using languages; it is about using logical deduction to decipher unknown languages. A typical linguistic problem often involves a corpus written in an exotic language along with clues that can help uncover how the language works and the corpus's meaning, but it can really be any strange problems like reading bar code or writing braille. When solving linguistic problems, one needs to be open-minded about the different ways natural languages might be constructed and pay close attention to subtle patterns that might reveal the characteristics of the target language.
