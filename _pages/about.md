# About NCU

NCU is is an organization dedicated to helping NCPA students to have a wider outlook for scholarship competitions. Comprehensive competition experience is an integral part of students' profiles, which is exactly what selective universities and colleges are looking for. For another, participating in competitions can help prepare students for college since academic competitions motivates them to better understand some of the complex topics in their field of interest, which can potentially enhance their class performance (GPA) at school. As a matter of fact, compared to outstanding performances in athletic competitions that the school organizes for sports teams each year, NCPA lacks formal organizations of academic competitions. To fill the space of potential improvement in this aspect, this organization will provide students a way to better understand themselves, develop further in subject information and research, and finally support themselves to have higher performances in the application of undergraduate programs.
